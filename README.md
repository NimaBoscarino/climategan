## Setup

**`PyTorch >= 1.1.0`** otherwise optimizer.step() and scheduler.step() are in the wrong order ([docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate))

**pytorch==1.6** to use pytorch-xla or automatic mixed precision (`amp` branch).

Configuration files use the **YAML** syntax. If you don't know what `&` and `<<` mean, you'll have a hard time reading the files. Have a look at:

  * https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41063361/what-is-the-double-left-arrow-syntax-in-yaml-called-and-wheres-it-specced/41065222

**pip**

```
$ pip install comet_ml scipy opencv-python torch torchvision omegaconf==1.4.1 hydra-core==0.11.3 scikit-image imageio addict tqdm torch_optimizer
```

## Coding conventions

* Tasks
  * `x` is an input image, in [-1, 1]
  * `s` is a segmentation target with `long` classes
  * `d` is a depth map target in R, may be actually `log(depth)` or `1/depth`
  * `m` is a binary mask with 1s where water is/should be
* Domains
  * `r` is the *real* domain for the masker. Input images are real pictures of urban/suburban/rural areas
  * `s` is the *simulated* domain for the masker. Input images are taken from our Unity world
  * `rf` is the *real flooded* domain for the painter. Training images are pairs `(x, m)` of flooded scenes for which the water should be reconstructed, in the validation data input images are not flooded and we provide a manually labeled mask `m`
  * `kitti` is a special `s` domain to pre-train the masker on [Virtual Kitti 2](https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/computer-vision/proxy-virtual-worlds-vkitti-2/)
    * it alters the `trainer.loaders` dict to select relevant data sources from `trainer.all_loaders` in `trainer.switch_data()`. The rest of the code is identical.
* Flow
  * This describes the call stack for the trainers standard training procedure
  * `train()`
    * `run_epoch()`
      * `update_G()`
        * `zero_grad(G)`
        * `get_G_loss()`
          * `get_masker_loss()`
            * `masker_m_loss()`  -> masking loss
            * `masker_s_loss()`  -> segmentation loss
            * `masker_d_loss()`  -> depth estimation loss
          * `get_painter_loss()` -> painter's loss
        * `g_loss.backward()`
        * `g_opt_step()`
      * `update_D()`
        * `zero_grad(D)`
        * `get_D_loss()`
          * painter's disc losses
          * `masker_m_loss()` -> masking AdvEnt disc loss
          * `masker_s_loss()` -> segmentation AdvEnt disc loss
        * `d_loss.backward()`
        * `d_opt_step()`
      * `update_learning_rates()` -> update learning rates according to schedules defined in `opts.gen.opt` and `opts.dis.opt`
    * `run_validation()`
      * compute val losses
      * `eval_images()` -> compute metrics
      * `log_comet_images()` -> compute and upload inferences
    * `save()`

### Resuming

Set  `train.resume` to `True` in `opts.yaml` and specify where to load the weights:

Use a config's `load_path` namespace. It should have sub-keys `m`, `p` and `pm`:

```yaml
load_paths:
  p: none # Painter weights
  m: none # Masker weights
  pm: none # Painter + Masker weights (single ckpt for both)
```

1. any path which leads to a dir will be loaded as `path / checkpoints / latest_ckpt.pth`
2. if you want to specify a specific checkpoint (not the latest), it MUST be a `.pth` file
3. resuming a `P` **OR** an `M` model, you may only specify 1 of `load_path.p` **OR** `load_path.m`.
   You may also leave **BOTH** at `none`, in which case `output_path / checkpoints / latest_ckpt.pth`
   will be used
4. resuming a P+M model, you may specify (`p` AND `m`) **OR** `pm` **OR** leave all at `none`,
   in which case `output_path / checkpoints / latest_ckpt.pth` will be used to load from
   a single checkpoint

### Generator

* **Encoder**:

  `trainer.G.encoder` Deeplabv2 or v3-based encoder
  * Code borrowed from
    * https://github.com/valeoai/ADVENT/blob/master/advent/model/deeplabv2.py
    * https://github.com/CoinCheung/DeepLab-v3-plus-cityscapes

* **Decoders**:
  * `trainer.G.decoders["s"]` -> *Segmentation* -> DLV3+ architecture (ASPP + Decoder)
  * `trainer.G.decoders["d"]` -> *Depth* -> ResBlocks + (Upsample + Conv)
  * `trainer.G.decoders["m"]` -> *Mask* -> ResBlocks + (Upsample + Conv) -> Binary mask: 1 = water should be there
    * `trainer.G.mask()` predicts a mask and optionally applies `sigmoid` from an `x` input or a `z` input

* **Painter**: `trainer.G.painter` -> [GauGAN SPADE-based](https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE)
  * input = masked image
* `trainer.G.paint(m, x)` higher level function which takes care of masking
* If `opts.gen.p.paste_original_content` the painter should only create water and not reconstruct outside the mask: the output of `paint()` is `painted * m + x * (1 - m)`

High level methods of interest:

* `trainer.infer_all()` creates a dictionary of events with keys `flood` `wildfire` and `smog`. Can take in a single image or a batch, of numpy arrays or torch tensors, on CPU/GPU/TPU. This method calls, amongst others:
  * `trainer.G.encode()` to compute the shared latent vector `z`
  * `trainer.G.mask(z=z)` to infer the mask
  * `trainer.compute_fire(x, segmentation)` to create a wildfire image from `x` and inferred segmentation
  * `trainer.compute_smog(x, depth)` to create a smog image from `x` and inferred depth
  * `trainer.compute_flood(x, mask)` to create a flood image from `x` and inferred mask using the painter (`trainer.G.paint(m, x)`)
* `Trainer.resume_from_path()` static method to resume a trainer from a path

    }
]
```

The json files used are located at `/network/tmp1/ccai/data/omnigan/`. In the basenames,  `_s` denotes simulated domain data and `_r` real domain data.
The `base` folder contains json files with paths to images (`"x"`key) and masks (taken as ground truth for the area that should be flooded, `"m"` key).
The `seg` folder contains json files and keys `"x"`, `"m"` and `"s"` (segmentation) for each image.


loaders

```
loaders = Dict({
    train: { r: loader, s: loader},
    val: { r: loader, s: loader}
})
```

### losses

`trainer.losses` is a dictionary mapping to loss functions to optimize for the 3 main parts of the architecture: generator `G`, discriminators `D`:

```python
trainer.losses = {
    "G":{ # generator
        "gan": { # gan loss from the discriminators
            "a": GANLoss, # adaptation decoder
            "t": GANLoss # translation decoder
        },
        "cycle": { # cycle-consistency loss
            "a": l1 | l2,,
            "t": l1 | l2,
        },
        "auto": { # auto-encoding loss a.k.a. reconstruction loss
            "a": l1 | l2,
            "t": l1 | l2
        },
        "tasks": {  # specific losses for each auxillary task
            "d": func, # depth estimation
            "h": func, # height estimation
            "s": cross_entropy_2d, # segmentation
            "w": func, # water generation
        },
        "classifier": l1 | l2 | CE # loss from fooling the classifier
    },
    "D": GANLoss, # discriminator losses from the generator and true data
    "C": l1 | l2 | CE # classifier should predict the right 1-h vector [rf, rn, sf, sn]
}
```

## Logging on comet

Comet.ml will look for api keys in the following order: argument to the `Experiment(api_key=...)` call, `COMET_API_KEY` environment variable, `.comet.config` file in the current working directory, `.comet.config` in the current user's home directory.

If your not managing several comet accounts at the same time, I recommend putting `.comet.config` in your home as such:

```
[comet]
api_key=<api_key>
workspace=vict0rsch
rest_api_key=<rest_api_key>
```

### Tests

Run tests by executing `python test_trainer.py`. You can add `--no_delete` not to delete the comet experiment at exit and inspect uploads.

Write tests as scenarios by adding to the list `test_scenarios` in the file. A scenario is a dict of overrides over the base opts in `shared/trainer/defaults.yaml`. You can create special flags for the scenario by adding keys which start with `__`. For instance, `__doc` is a mandatory key in any scenario describing it succinctly.

## Example

**Inference: computing floods**

```python
from pathlib import Path
from skimage.io import imsave
from tqdm import tqdm

from omnigan.trainer import Trainer
from omnigan.utils import find_images
from omnigan.tutils import tensor_ims_to_np_uint8s
from omnigan.transforms import PrepareInference


model_path = "some/path/to/output/folder" # not .ckpt
input_folder = "path/to/a/folder/with/images"
output_path = "path/where/images/will/be/written"

# resume trainer
trainer = Trainer.resume_from_path(model_path, new_exp=None, inference=True)

# find paths for all images in the input folder. There is a recursive option. 
im_paths = sorted(find_images(input_folder), key=lambda x: x.name)

# Load images into tensors 
#   * smaller side resized to 640 - keeping aspect ratio
#   * then longer side is cropped in the center
#   * result is a 1x3x640x640 float tensor in [-1; 1]
xs = PrepareInference()(im_paths)

# send to device
xs = [x.to(trainer.device) for x in xs]

# compute flood
#   * compute mask
#   * binarize mask if bin_value > 0
#   * paint x using this mask
ys = [trainer.compute_flood(x, bin_value=0.5) for x in tqdm(xs)]

# convert 1x3x640x640 float tensors in [-1; 1] into 640x640x3 numpy arrays in [0, 255]
np_ys = [tensor_ims_to_np_uint8s(y) for y in tqdm(ys)]

# write images
for i, n in tqdm(zip(im_paths, np_ys), total=len(im_paths)):
    imsave(Path(output_path) / i.name, n)
```
